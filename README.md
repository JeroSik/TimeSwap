# TimeSwap
Code repository for Hello World Hackathon project: TimeSwap

TimeSwap is a Google Chrome extension that makes remembering time zone differences a thing of the past.

The extension, when active, will read the user's system set time zone, parse a webpage for any relevant time zone info in ANY time zone and then convert the info to the user's specific time zone info.

Plans for the future include pushing this extension to other browsers.

Made in collaboration with Noah Alderton, Jatin Singhal, and Youngsik Yoon.

# GeoTrash
A Google Chrome extension that parses a webpage for time zones and converts the time to the user's specific time zone. During Hello World 2017 Purdue, a 24 hour hackathon held at Purdue University designed to introduce freshman students to the hacker community, our team decided to focus on creating a convenient way to browse the web.
