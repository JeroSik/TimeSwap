# TimeSwap
A Google Chrome extension that parses a webpage for time zones and converts the time to the user's specific time zone. During Hello World 2017 Purdue, a 24 hour hackathon held at Purdue University designed to introduce freshman students to the hacker community, our team decided to focus on creating a convenient way to browse the web.
