# TimeSwap
Code repository for Hello World Hackathon project: TimeSwap

TimeSwap is a Google Chrome extension that makes remembering time zone differences a thing of the past.

The extension, when active, will read the user's system set time zone, parse a webpage for any relevant time zone info in ANY time zone and then convert the info to the user's specific time zone info.

Plans for the future include pushing this extension to other browsers.

Made in collaboration with Noah Alderton, Jatin Singhal, and Youngsik Yoon.
